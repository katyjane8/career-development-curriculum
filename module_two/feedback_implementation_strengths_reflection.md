# Feedback III Reflection

* What are you doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator?
I think I'm working well with my teams - where I thought I was being bossy it doesn't seem that way. I like to work together and communicate a lot, and I am a responsible person, which seemed to be the top blind spot for me. 

* How do you use your strengths as a team member?
To keep the group going. I just hope I can contribute more in an intelligent way, not just as a cheerleader or someone who is just organized. 

* How would you like to continue to develop your strengths?
I need to assert myself more as authority on certain subjects so that I can use my knowledge to drive the team as well.

* What would you like to improve on as a teammate? 
Voicing my smarts more. Not just my good attitude. 

* How would you like your teammates to see you?
As someone who is intelligent as well as cheerful.
